# Margaret Mitchell: Bias in AI
*Bias in the Vision and Language of Artificial Intelligence*

**Bias**
- Reporting bias: What people share is not a reflection of real-world frequencies
- Selection Bias: Selection does not reflect a random sample
- Out-group homogeneity bias: People tend to see outgroup members as more alike than ingroup members when comparing attitudes, values, personality traits, and other characteristics

**Interpretation**
- Confirmation bias: The tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information in a way that confirms one's preexisting beliefs or hypotheses
- Overgeneralization: Coming to conclusion based on information that is too general and/or not specific enough
- Correlation fallacy: Confusing correlation with causation
- Automation bias: Propensity for humans to favor suggestions from automated decision-making systems over contradictory information without automation

> Media wants to sell the story, and so it's part of our job as researchers, that people who work on this stuff, to be very clear about what the technology is actually doing, and make a distinction between what you might think it's doing and what it's actually doing.

**Data Really, Really Matters**
- Understand your Data: skews, correlations
- Abandon single training-set / testing-set from similar distribution
- Combine inputs from multiple sources
- Use held-out test set for hard use cases
- Talk to experts about additional signals
